# uMapTerritories

A self-hosted tool that can turn your [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) map file into territories accessible on your own domain like yourdomain.com/polygonName.
It's useful in some cases when you run campaigns and you need your people to be able to have quick access to their territories.
